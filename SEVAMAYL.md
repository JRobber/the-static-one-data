SEVAMAYL (Sleep Everyman As Much As You Like)
-----------------------------------------------
This schedule is experimental and not well tested, with the specifics still being under debate and scrutiny.  It is strongly recommended that inexperienced polyphasers do NOT attempt this schedule and instead stick to something better tested (such as E2 or E3).
-----------------------------------------------
**Invented by**: aethermind- 
**Total sleep**: Undefined, but on average around 5 hours- 
**Classification**: Flexi schedule in an Everyman style- 
**Specification**: 1 core, multiple short naps- 
**Mechanism**: Variant of SPAMAYL which includes a core sleep. The core sleep provides SWS and some REM, with naps providing the remaining REM. Strong reliance on the ability to detect when the need to rest is, to get quality REM naps.
**Adaptation difficulty**: Variable- 
**Ideal scheduling**: Around a 4 hour core (3 x 80 mins) with up to 6 naps of 10-20 minutes in length. Nap spacing should take into account natural periods of tiredness. Some longer naps might be plausible if all SWS has already been accounted for
