-----------------------------------------------
This is an experimental schedule currently being tested. Results unknown. No signs of successful adaptations.
-----------------------------------------------

**Total sleep**: Around 3-4 hours- Identification: Ultrashort naps- 
**Specification**: Multiple 20-min short naps, core sleep simulation- 
**Mechanism**: Multiple 20-min naps are stacked together; one wakes up after 20-min nap then go back to sleep immediately for another 20-min nap. Rinse and repeat. Naps can be stacked together any time possible, as many as needed, or just 1 20-min nap at a time is needed, in case of emergency. The stacked 20-min naps can form a disrupted core sleep/ longer nap. Theoretically the naps prevent one from reaching the completely wakeful state while one still remains somewhat in a sleepy state (last minutes of REM) to ease fall asleep back and as a way to "resume" the sleep cycle from lighter stages of sleep (or continuing in REM and SWS); however, it still grants the ability to nap in only 20 minutes. The schedule creates an impression of having both a "core" sleep for sustainability like any other schedules with at least one continuous core sleep, while containing multiple small power naps to promote vivid dreams. After adaptation, it is assumed that adapters can stack naps or take lone nap whenever they are sleepy enough, similar to SPAMAYL.
**Adaptation difficulty**: Unknown- 
**Ideal scheduling**: Stack naps in the night, avoid napping much in the day.Popularity: Virtually non-existent
