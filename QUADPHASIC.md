Quadphasic (Quadphasic)
**Total sleep**: 4 hours- Identification: Dual Core sleep, Dymaxion naps- 
**Specification**: 2 core sleeps of minimum length, 2 naps, and the late Dymaxion nap can contain both SWS and REM.
**Mechanism**: One core sleep before midnight, one around dawn, Dymaxion noon nap, and Dymaxion afternoon nap. Sleep stage division: Dusk core SWS, dawn core REM. Late nap can contain mixed sleep stages. More flexible than Dymaxion because there are 2 core sleeps to gain SWS and so 2 naps can be moved around to some extent.
**Adaptation difficulty**: Super hard- 
**Ideal scheduling**: The whole scheduleâ€™s sleep distribution looks like Dymaxion's- one core before midnight, one core around dawn, one noon nap, one afternoon/evening nap.Popularity: Very low
